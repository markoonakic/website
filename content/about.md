Hi — I'm Marko. I've been fiddling with computers for as long as I can remember. At nine, I was already attending a programming school and learning the basics. I have always had this need to tinker, understand WHY something works the way it does, or is the way it is. I've never truly been satisfied with having a rudimentary understanding of a subject that interests me. I derive great satisfaction from an in-depth understanding of things. The feeling of things "clicking" after putting in a great amount of effort into researching a topic.

This led me to pursue a wide variety of interests during my relatively short lifetime, some of which, I'll be writing about here.

Currently, I'm a final year Software Engineering student expanding my knowledge in the field of DevOps. About 2 years ago I configured and ran my first personal server, and ever since then I have been endlessly chipping away at everything the field of DevOps has to offer.
