                <p>Hi — I&rsquo;m Marko. I&rsquo;ve been fiddling with computers for as long as I can remember. At nine, I was already attending a programming school and learning the basics. I have always had this need to tinker, understand WHY something works the way it does, or is the way it is. I&rsquo;ve never truly been satisfied with having a rudimentary understanding of a subject that interests me. I derive great satisfaction from an in-depth understanding of things. The feeling of things &ldquo;clicking&rdquo; after putting in a great amount of effort into researching a topic.</p>
<p>This led me to pursue a wide variety of interests during my relatively short lifetime, some of which, I&rsquo;ll be writing about here.</p>
<p>Currently, I&rsquo;m a final year Software Engineering student expanding my knowledge in the field of DevOps. About 2 years ago I configured and ran my first personal server, and ever since then I have been endlessly chipping away at everything the field of DevOps has to offer.</p>
